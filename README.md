# ChainChecker

This repository contains code to prepare sequences for the ChainChecker app.  ChainChecker combines genetic and epidemiological data into a single plot.  First, align genomes of interest using your favorite aligner.  Next, feed that alignment into the ipython notebook.  Cells are run in sequential order and first make a 1) Matrix, 2) Source /tab/ Recipient /tab/ distance file, and 3) Reformatted (using only epiIDS and not labIDs_epiIDS) Source /tab/ Recipient /tab/ distance file.
